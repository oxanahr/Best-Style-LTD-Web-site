# Best-Style-LTD-Web-site
Telerik Academy Alpha Web project
A website intended to advertise the work of Best Style Ltd.
The company offers designer services in the textile business.
  
 It helps mid and small sized textile enterprises to develop new models, to produce patterns for custom models, 
 as well as mass-produced ones in numerous sizes. 
 The website has several pages:
  1. Home page with short descriptions of the services. On it there are links to:
    a. A separate page with a gallery of finished models, from which patterns can be ordered with the size of the client.
     b. Each model can be seen on a separate page with a detailed description. 
   c. A separate page with a contact form and a map with a marked location.
    
 The following pages are not completely functional:
	1. Offers for textiles and supplies.
	2. A catalogue with available professional machines to rent or to buy.
  3. A forum page that allows users to register and discuss related subjects.
	
The project is not complete and it is necessary to test different functions.
